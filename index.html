                <strong>Beyond The Supremacy, personal project</strong>. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
                This is a personal project I’m working on, where I’ve created and designed various characters within a complex and entirely new universe. Through this world, I explore themes of power, fate, and defiance, shaping a story where every choice matters.

In a world where there is always someone stronger, wiser, and more powerful, Alan refuses to submit. Marked by abandonment, betrayal, and cruelty, her goal is clear: to surpass everyone—even the supreme gods—and become the ultimate force. Her story begins after years of torment in a corrupt orphanage when she loses control of her powers, unleashing a destructive fury that alters her fate forever.

In her fight for supremacy, Alan will face increasingly powerful enemies, questioning whether absolute power is truly attainable or merely an illusion. The player will decide whether Alan descends into madness or finds a new purpose, as the universe itself seeks to chain her down and strip away the only thing she has left: her freedom.
            </p>

<div class="mt-5">
    <h4 class="text-center text-secondary">Alan</h4>
    <p class="text-muted text-center">
        Alan is a being shaped by chaos, betrayal, and an insatiable hunger for power. In a universe where true justice does not exist, she refuses to accept a fate of submission. There will always be someone stronger, wiser, and more powerful—but for Alan, acknowledging inferiority is the same as admitting defeat. She was abandoned as a child, raised in a corrupt church that saw her not as a person, but as a vessel. Those who were meant to protect her succumbed to greed, sealing powerful demons within her in a reckless attempt to control forces beyond their understanding. Yet, rather than enslaving her, the demons recognized her as a worthy host, a being capable of wielding their power as her own. This event marked a turning point in history—no one could have foreseen the extent of Alan’s true potential.

Her appearance tells the story of her struggle. An albino girl with ghostly pale skin and unkempt, self-cut hair, her fragile image contrasts with the brutal reality of her existence. Scars and bloodstained bandages adorn her body, remnants of battles fought both internally and externally. Tattoos symbolizing the demons within her are etched into her skin, a permanent reminder of her curse and her strength. When necessary, she manifests two demonic arms, cloaked in shadowy protection, a reflection of her bond with the entities that reside inside her. As the daughter of the God of Fire, she wields his elemental power, but it does not always obey her will—losing control comes at a painful cost, leaving her body burned and broken.

Alan is as emotionally volatile as she is powerful. She experiences emotions in extremes, unable to properly identify or process them, with pain being the only sensation she fully understands. Her paranoia fuels her manipulative nature, using others as tools to further her own goals. Deeply self-destructive, she seeks physical suffering as a means to prove her own existence, to feel something beyond the monstrous emptiness inside her. Her obsession with power drives her forward, a relentless pursuit to surpass even the gods she despises.

Yet, despite the chaos raging within, Alan maintains a façade of calm and control, concealing the storm beneath the surface. She is the embodiment of duality—immensely strong yet deeply broken, a force of destruction and vulnerability intertwined. Whether she succumbs to madness or rises beyond the limits of existence is a question only time can answer.

    <h4 class="text-center text-secondary">Igne</h4>
    <p class="text-muted text-center">
        For Igne, fire is not a symbol of divine glory but a constant reminder of his inability to control what should define him. His daughter, Alan, embodies this failure—not only inheriting his power but also his burden: a fire that burns with an intensity that consumes even those who bear it. Alan despises him not for what he is, but for what he was not—a father, a protector, someone capable of holding the flame without letting it destroy those around him. From a distance, Igne watches the chaos his lineage has sown, trapped in a philosophical dilemma: can a being defined by both creation and destruction ever attain redemption? His immortality does not hold the answer, nor does his power—it lies in his inability to be human. Though he cannot love as mortals do, he also cannot sever himself from the emotions that his union with Erika and the birth of Alan awakened in him. The eternal, scorching fire is both his essence and his curse, a reflection of his divine obsession. He seeks in Alan the humanity he lost by ignoring her existence, hoping that a spark of it might make him worthy of something more than the fearful reverence mortals offer to the gods. Yet the more he tries to reach her, the fiercer Alan’s fury burns. Thus, Igne lives as a paradox: omnipotent yet powerless when it comes to the bonds that truly matter. His existence serves as a reminder that even gods are subject to the immutable laws of humanity. And as long as the fire burns, Igne will continue to consume himself in his own flames, searching for a purpose that, like everything in his domain, may ultimately turn to ashes.
        Igne, the God of Fire and King of the Realm, has a presence both majestic and imposing. His crimson hair moves like living flames, and his tanned skin radiates warmth, reflecting his elemental nature. He wears flowing, Grecian-inspired garments adorned with gold, symbolizing his divine status. His golden accessories bear intricate engravings, representing his power and responsibility.

Once ruled by his fiery temper, Igne's personality evolved through his relationship with Erika. His love for her softened his once-destructive nature, teaching him patience and compassion. However, his deep devotion is both his greatest strength and weakness, sometimes leading him to impulsive decisions. Though now more controlled, his intensity remains, surfacing in moments of crisis. His presence is commanding—his steps firm, his voice resonant, and his gaze piercing.

Igne embodies the dual nature of fire: destruction, creation, and protection. His story is one of struggle, torn between his divine essence and the humanity Erika taught him to embrace.

                Each illustration has been carefully crafted to convey distinct emotions and sensations through the thoughtful use of color and composition. The aim has been to capture the essence of each character while interpreting it through my own artistic lens. By playing with light, shadow, and dynamic arrangements, I strive to evoke the internal struggles, motivations, and personalities of the characters. The choice of hues, contrasts, and textures are intended to reflect not only the physical aspects but also the emotional depth and complexity inherent in each figure. Through these illustrations, I seek to create an immersive experience that invites the viewer to explore the narrative and character dynamics on a deeper, more personal level.

                To further develop my artistic skills and improve my understanding of visual storytelling, I engaged in various practice exercises, adapting my work to the style of Hazbin Hotel. Through this process, I gained valuable insights, refined my techniques, and ultimately shaped my own artistic style.

                This section features a collection of characters reimagined in a chibi style, each brought to life with exaggerated features and endearing proportions. These representations aim to capture the core essence of the characters, offering a playful and charming take on their iconic traits. Through the simplicity of chibi design, I’ve explored a lighter, more adorable version of these figures, while still honoring the qualities that make them memorable and inspiring.

                                    Hi! My name is Miriam Sanz Tardón, and my passion is both drawing and writing. I also love playing video games, which is why I’m working hard to turn all of these passions into my career. Creating worlds, telling stories, and bringing characters to life through illustration and animation is what truly drives me, and I’m always striving to learn and improve.
                                </p>
                                <p class="lead">
                                    I’m a concept artist, illustrator, and 2D animator with a deep passion for visual storytelling and character design. I studied Game Design and Development, a challenging journey that pushed me to grow as an artist. However, everything changed when I discovered Helluva Boss and Hazbin Hotel. These series not only helped me understand key artistic concepts, but also allowed me to find my own style and feel truly comfortable with my work. From that moment on, I’ve been dedicated to improving my skills, learning new techniques, and pushing my creativity further. Everything I know about art, I’ve learned on my own, constantly striving to evolve. Now, my goal is to bring my experience, passion, and unique artistic vision to projects that, like these series, blend striking aesthetics with powerful storytelling.
